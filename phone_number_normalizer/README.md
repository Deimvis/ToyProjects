# Phone Number Normalizer

_Inspired by [Gophercises](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)_

Literally reads phone numbers from given file, inserts them into Postgres table and then inserts normalized versions into another Postgres table.<br>
_So boring, I know_

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# set env variables (see .env.template)
go run main.go -file=numbers.txt
```
